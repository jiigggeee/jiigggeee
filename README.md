- 👋 Hi! I'm a DBA for hire who loves database design, modeling, and management. 
- 👀 I’m interested in getting better at Python, building nice database models/live products, and leveling up at EVERYTHING.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Python, Jupyter Notebook, and advanced SQL Server skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on database stuff and anything else that seems viable.
- If you like PostgreSQL let's talk!

Say hey.
