- 👋 Hi! I'm a tech worker for hire. Classically trained in database design and management as well as web development.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting better at Python, building nice database models/live products, and beating the impostor syndrome.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning advanced Python and jumping back into OSINT.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything relevant, worthwhile and/or fun.

Say hey.
